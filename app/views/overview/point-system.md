# The point system

Points are the currency of Highway! Here's everything you need to know about them. 

As always, if you have any questions, ask in #highway!

*This page will be updated as more questions get asked.*

**Points correlate to *complexity*, not cost.**

## Getting points
Here's a short brief on all the ways you can get points!

*Generally speaking, to qualify for Undercity, you can expect to get to get 6-10 of your points from building projects, and 2 from side quests!*

### Building projects

This is the primary way to get points! When you get a project approved, you can get the following points:

- **Starter projects**: 1/4 points (solder/hackpad)
- **Tier 3 projects**: 4 points
- **Tier 2 projects**: 6 points
- **Tier 1 projects**: 10 points

You can also get 1-2 extra points if you build an extra polished project! This is up to the discretion of your reviewer. Examples include:

- [@samliu's hackpad](https://github.com/samdev-7/squarepad) (was 4pts, now 6!)
- [@Parker Rupe's 3D printer](https://github.com/ProgrammerTurtle/DoNotDelta) (was 10, now 11!)
- [@dld's Minecraft Jukebox!](https://github.com/danieliscrazy/Jukebox) (was 6, now 7!)

### Doing sidequests!
Need a couple extra points! Not to fear - introducing **sidequests** - these are small tasks you can do to get extra points!

#### Weekly work sessions
Every week, we'll run 1-2 zoom calls where you can get a point. It'll be anywhere from 2-4 hours where we all work on our Highway projects. Anyone who posts an update by the end of it can get an extra point!

#### Writing a guide
If you've physically built a project before, either from highway or somewhere else, feel free to write a [guide](/guides) on it! It's basically a blogpost-style document intended to tell the story of how you built a project! Get 1 point if it gets merged.

#### Showcases
Every so often we'll bring in a personality like Strange Parts, Zack Freedman, and more to Hack Club. Some of these will be designated as a show n'tell session - if you showcase your project in one of these calls, you can get an extra point!

#### More
Have ideas for a sidequest? recommend them in #highway!
